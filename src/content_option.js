    aboutme: "I’m a Product Designer with over a decade of experience working across physical and digital products, focused on UX, product strategy, and complex systems. I work end to end—from discovery and research to interaction design and delivery—partnering closely with product, engineering, and stakeholders to turn complexity into clear, scalable, and meaningful experiences. My approach balances strategic thinking with hands-on execution, aligning user needs, business objectives, and technical constraints, particularly in regulated and high-stakes environments. I believe great design is intentional, inclusive, and outcome-driven—less about aesthetics, and more about creating clarity, enabling better decisions, and building products that deliver long-term value.",
